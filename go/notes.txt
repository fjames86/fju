Notes on using golang

1. install and setup go
 - download from website and extra to /usr/local
2. set GOPATH to `pwd`/fju/go
3. setup emacs go-mode 
 - download from github/dominikh/go-mode
 - follow install instructions

;; ---------------------

What do we want to achieve?
 - xdr/rpc implementation (just write native go implementation rather than calling into the C one)
 - wrappers to some fju apis e.g. log, freg,
 - statically link to liblog, libfreg etc rather than dynamically to libfju.so

want:
 - single module for fju library (combination of native go routines and wrappers to libfju)
 -
