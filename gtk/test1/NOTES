How to write GTK+ applications

1. Install gtk development libraries

libgtk-3-dev
glade


2. Install glade gui. This is a gui painter for gtk.
It generates xml files which can be linked into application binaries
for use in generating gtk guis.

3. in glade, specify callback handler function names for the "signals" you want
each control (widget) to handle. E.g. the main application window needs to handle
the destroy signal so that it can call gtk_main_quit() to cause the main loop to exit.
Buttons will want to handle the clicked signal etc.

4. Add lines to resources.xml file to include the .glade files in the compiled binary.
